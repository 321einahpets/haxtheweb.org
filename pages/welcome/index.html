<h2>HAX is short for Headless Authoring Experience</h2>
<p>It is a next generation WYSIWYG that's built in Web components and can talk to any web component / HTML tag in it's body area so long as it emits HAXschema; a simple JSON object.</p>
<h2>Why HAX?</h2>
<p>There's no reason to tightly couple editing experience to the platform you are working on. Justify to a customer why a video-player on a web page requires a lot of work on the backend in order for them to leverage it. It's a hard sell even if it's justified. But the video player below is a single tag on the interface that works in any system (see below for code-sample, another tag presenting this one)</p>
<video-player sticky-corner="top-right" source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrS7dqokTLE" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></video-player>
<code-sample>  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">// this isn't really script, just doing this to annotate
<script>
// the tag opening just like normal HTML
<video-player
// a custom property to make the video stick in the corner
sticky-corner="top-right"
// link to the youtube video
source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrS7dqokTLE"
// normal looking style attributes, it is a html tag after all
style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">
// closing tag, though there could have been information in here
</video-player>
</script></template>
</code-sample>
<p>In fact the code above is using a tag called <b>< code - sample ></b>
 to present itself! These elements work anywhere. Dig into the rest of the site for further documentation, integrations and how to get involved in <i>HAX The Web</i>
