<p slot="col-1">HAXcms, which powers this website, is hard to describe exactly what "kind" of system it is. That's because given that it's 100% web components, decoupled, and static by design, it's hard to put it in a category so let's just spell out some of the key features and you can decide</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul><li>Micro-site manager, so manage multiple sites from a single HAXcms install</li>
<li>Each site is powered by static files which live in version control</li>

<li>Every change is executed by the front end via HAX / Outline tools</li>
<li>Every change is automatically tracked in version control (zip the folder and send it to a friend and it'll work)</li>
<li>The "database" is powered by a site.json file that lives with the site</li>
<li>All operations write to static files so every change is as if you editing HTML by hand (but you didn't... HAX did)</li>
<li>Ability to serve up as a static site on CDNs (this site is on GH pages + a CDN) via Publishing which makes a purely static copy with a service worker and the whole jazz for offline / installable capability (0 config)</li>
<li>Build your own themes via custom front end dev if you like or use one of our baked in ones</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">So it's a flat file generator with a UI and the UI contextually loads based on if you should see it. It's weird, we know, and that's also why we have trouble describing what it is. It's a flat file CMS without tooling required. It's a sustainable way of building and maintaining a "CMS" as it has multiple pages, can handle custom fields, custom themes, but yet it doesn't require infrastructure to keep running beyond PHP / node / Beaker browser to act as a back end to edit the static files.</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">It's an organic CMS. A living yet permanent website. It's hacking the limitations of content authoring capabilities. It's why we say, we're HAX The Web.</span></p>
