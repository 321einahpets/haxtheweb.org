<h3 class="hax-active">Live Demo</h3>
<p>This website is an example of the HAXeditor running in HAXcms but does not have a backend to save things. If you'd like a live demo, <a href="https://www.elmsln.org/demos">the ELMS:LN community has provided one that resets all user generated content hourly</a>

<h3 class="hax-active">Notes about this website</h3>
<p>When you use HAXeditor in your own system, everyone won't be able to see this but, just for this website we made something special. HAX mode is activated even though you're not logged in! You can't save (duh) but at least you can see what all the hype is about. So go ahead, click the bottom right and get this party started playing with all the capabilities HAX has to offer!</p>
