<p>When you use HAXeditor in your own system, everyone won't be able to see this but, just for this website we made something special. HAX mode is activated even though you're not logged in! You can't save (duh) but at least you can see what all the hype is about. So go ahead, click the bottom right and get this party started playing with all the capabilities HAX has to offer!</p>
