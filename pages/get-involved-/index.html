<h2><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">University / Organization that wants to get involved?</span></h2>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Great! Here's some of the best ways for organizations to try "HAX" and get involved in the project.</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reach out to any of the members of the core project team or who's listed at the bottom of the FAQ. We're happy to do conference calls to forge partnerships especially around HAX as a Learning management or OER production solution though it has implications for any public site!</span></li>
<li>Try out the <a href="https://www.elmsln.org/demos">HAXcms live demo</a>
 (this website has no backend)</li>
<li>Reach out in in the <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms">HAXcms issue queue</a>
 with questions</li>
<li>Bring this website to developers in your organization or other code junkies and tell them to explore</li>
</ul>
<p>HAX makes up multiple projects across hundreds of web components and various other repos. It can be a bit overwhelming but I want you to imagine something... Imagine being a developer on HAX.</p>

<p>Because all it takes to get involved in HAX is, that's right, showing up in our repos and getting involved! Yes you too can be just as special and meme-able as we are!</p>
<p>All things HAX are powered by people just like you, wanting to make the web a better, more accessible, easier to use, less painful to develop for... place.<span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Help us make that a reality and you too could have Snoop Dawg escorting you over to a brand new car*</span></p>
