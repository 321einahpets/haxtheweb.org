<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<ul><li>Support any platform (CMS, App, etc) that supports the Web components standard</li>
<li>Empower authors to write a lot of code without ever looking at it</li>
<li>All content produced should work with or without HAX</li>
<li>Attempt to support legacy content editor mark up as best we can</li>
<li>HAX will learn what the rules of producing elements are, it won't dictate them</li>

<li>Decentralize all the things</li>

</ul>
<h4>Cross platform</h4>
<p>Because we've adopted the <a href="https://webcomponents.org/">web component</a>










 standard in the development of both HAX (authoring system) and HAXCMS (content management), everything we create and compile via our <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory">open tooling</a>










 we can support about 98.6% of all browser traffic globally without any server side rendering. This means that you can use the latest and greatest of the web and not have to constantly worry about a library changing!!</p>
<h4>Platform support</h4>
<ul><li>Chrome, Safari, Opera, iOS, Android, Firefox - no polyfill, last 3 versions!<br/></li>







<li>IE 11 / Edge / legacy everything - aggressive polyfills</li>
</ul>

<p>The elements that make up HAX can be delivered via a CDN or installed locally. This means that the functionality is tied <b>to the browser</b>










 and <b>NOT</b>










 to the platform itself (huh?). Well, think of all the complex functionality of any site you've ever built or used. Then add content to that site. Now move that site (in your mind) to another server. What has to be migrated to maintain the content functioning that isn't actually content?</p>
<h4>For example, take this quiz:</h4>
<multiple-choice title="Decoupled question" check-label="Check answer" reset-label="Reset" hide-title question="Is this decoupled... I mean.. REALLY decoupled, if it would work on other webpages?" correct-text="Great job!" incorrect-text="Better luck next time!" randomize typeof="oer:Assessment" resource="#dd2feacf-ed4a-dcb0-b85d" prefix="oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org " answers="[{&quot;correct&quot;:null,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Umm.. I think?&quot;},{&quot;correct&quot;:true,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Yeah this really will work anywhere!&quot;,&quot;userGuess&quot;:false},{&quot;correct&quot;:null,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Decoupled?&quot;},{&quot;correct&quot;:null,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;There's no way it actually is&quot;}]"></multiple-choice>
