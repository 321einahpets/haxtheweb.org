<h2>How HAX fits into your organization</h2>
<p>HAX (and HAXCMS) are trying to lead you to education's "Roku Remote" moment. By that I mean, a world where you have a very simple little box (HAXCMS) that can be controlled in a completely uniform, simple manner (HAX) that actually pulls together a universe of content and media from across your organization. HAX helps bridge the knowledge gap between content creators and content publishers. It eliminates most of the work involved in publishing (that none of us want to do anyway)!</p>
