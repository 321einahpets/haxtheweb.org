<h2>Is this really real?</h2>
<p>Yes. Web components turn your site effectively into an API. HAXeditor just leverages this fact and standards that exist in order to supply an incredible amount of functionality on the front end of the browser. We can do the vast majority of what many CMS and content solutions provide without a back end. Just HTML files and a h-a-x tag to understand how to modify them.</p>
<h2>Do I have to use the elements HAX supplies?</h2>
<p>No. HAXeditor is written such that <a href="hax-appstore-specification">Appstore Specification</a>
 is defining the elements that HAX has access to in the demos on this site. Leveraging the <i>autoloader</i>
 piece of the spec you can tell HAX which tags to load. The tag definitions and schema associated with those tags don't have to be the same.</p>
<h2>Do these elements require HAX to operate?</h2>
<p>No. HAX can modify HTML inside of it and then export to HTML and that HTML isn't tied to HAX. HAX is effectively writing the same HTML you could by hand. Web components help make it semantic but also ensure that functionality lives with "the platform"; in this case, the platform being the browser itself. So long as the definitions of the component are in scope of the page, the element will unpack correctly HAX or otherwise.</p>
<h2>Where did this come from?</h2>
<p>HAX is the brain child of the ELMS:LN team at Pennsylvania State University. Lead by Bryan Ollendyke (@<a href="https://twitter.com/btopro">btopro</a>
), HAX is the authoring solution created to power ELMS:LN and other systems to improve educational outcomes through better experiences.</p>
<p>There is nothing we can't do together.</p>
