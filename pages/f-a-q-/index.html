<h2>Is this really real?</h2>
<p>Yes. Web components turn your site effectively into an API. HAXeditor just leverages this fact and standards that exist in order to supply an incredible amount of functionality on the front end of the browser. We can do the vast majority of what many CMS and content solutions provide without a back end. Just HTML files and a h-a-x tag to understand how to modify them.</p>
<h2>Do I have to use the elements HAX supplies?</h2>
<p>No. HAXeditor is written such that <a href="hax-appstore-specification">Appstore Specification</a>


 is defining the elements that HAX has access to in the demos on this site. Leveraging the <i>autoloader</i>


 piece of the spec you can tell HAX which tags to load. The tag definitions and schema associated with those tags don't have to be the same.</p>
<h2>Do these elements require HAX to operate?</h2>
<p>No. HAX can modify HTML inside of it and then export to HTML and that HTML isn't tied to HAX. HAX is effectively writing the same HTML you could by hand. Web components help make it semantic but also ensure that functionality lives with "the platform"; in this case, the platform being the browser itself. So long as the definitions of the component are in scope of the page, the element will unpack correctly HAX or otherwise.</p>
<h2>How does this compare to the WordPress Gutenberg plugin?</h2>
<p>In terms of mission and what they attempt to provide, a click and build website tonight, no-or-minimal-code solution for the masses... they are the same. They both seek to reduce barriers to entry in web expression. HAX takes some critical differences in philosophy of design to Gutenberg both in technical implementation and goals for the open web.</p>
<p>HAX seeks to improve web publishing for all systems, HAXcms or otherwise. HAXcms (which this site is constructed in) is but a tiny fraction of the web and we want to empower anyone to improve self expression. We want to improve privacy, self sovereignty, and the individuality of all peoples on the web. HAX seeks to eliminate technical barriers to production, integration and delivery of material on the internet; all of it, not just the expensive CMS part of it. We want to hax-the-web, hence this domain name.</p>
<p>Some larger points of different are highlighted below</p>
<ul><li>HAX is platform independent - We seek to improve the web and all that it touches, platform agnostic. Gutenberg is highly focused on the needs of WordPress and improving the content authoring experience for WordPress users.</li>

<li>Gutenberg embeds it's blocks layer with the authoring nuance such that all operations can be wildly different per block. For example, a tabbed list of items may have a "add another" button inline with the block. HAX believes that the editing experience across complex elements must be delivered by the HAXeditor, not the element or block level. This illustrates itself in the UX as users selecting an element to work on and then interfacing with it the same way they would any other element. We feel that this will reduce long term barriers to adoption by end-users and training through a lack of cognitive load increase per element.</li>

<li>Gutenberg sees you "add" things as it's primary construction method. If you need to upload media that's a separately integrated process, highly dependent on WordPress to deliver. HAX boils content creation operations down into the mental model of the author. Authors either say "I need to <b>Add</b>

 something" (Add menu), "I need to to <b>Find</b>

 something" (Find menu), "I need to <b>Make</b>

 something" (Make / create menu), "I need to <b>Layout</b>

 something" (Blox / Layout menu) or that they want to remix something from a <b>Template</b>

 (Stax / Template menu).</li>

<li>The Gutenberg blocks system produces react components which are specific to the logistics of WordPress or traditional CMS solutions. The elements produced for HAX work in and out of HAX capable systems. We believe in extending the broader capabilities of the web first and HAX second. To reduces duplication of efforts globally and improves resource sharing.</li>

<li>Gutenberg is written in React, effectively requiring all plugins and block components be written in React. HAX is written in Web components leveraging a mix of "VanillaJS" and Polymer constructed elements. You can use any web component compatible library in order to produce elements for HAX. While not limited to, here are some popular examples that could natively talk to HAX:</li>

<ul><li>VanillaJS, web components following the custom element specification</li>

<li>Polymer</li>

<li>LitElement</li>

<li>SkateJS</li>

<li>Slim.js</li>

<li>Svelte</li>

<li>VueJS (web component wrapper)</li>

<li>Angular Components (compiled to custom elements)</li>

<li>Any library that passes testing on <a href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/">custom-elements-everywhere</a>

 should work</li>

</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Where did this come from?</h2>
<p>HAX is the brain child of the <a href="https://www.elmsln.org/">ELMS:LN team at Pennsylvania State University</a>
. HAX is the authoring solution originally created to power <a href="https://elmsln.org/">ELMS:LN</a>
 and other instructional innovations and was quickly realized for its potential to transform open web publishing.</p>
<p>The original core development / evangelist team on HAX in it's infancy (and idea conceived in 2016, experimented in 2017, manifested in 2018, actualized in 2019):</p>
<ul><li>Bryan Ollendyke (<a href="https://twitter.com/btopro">@btopro</a>

<li>Michael Potter (<a href="https://twitter.com/hey__mp">@hey__mp</a>

<li>Nikki Massaro-Kauffman (<a href="https://twitter.com/nikkimk">@nikkimk</a>

<li>Charles Lavera (<a href="https://twitter.com/cgldevel">@cgldevel</a>

<li>Michael Collins (<a href="https://twiiter.com/_mike_collins">@_mike_collins</a>

<li>Melissa Hicks (<a href="https://twitter.com/juststormy">@juststormy</a>

</ul>
<p>There is nothing we can't do together.</p>
